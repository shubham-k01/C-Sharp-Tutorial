# C# Tutorial Repository 🎉


## Introduction 🧑‍💻

C# (pronounced "C-Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for developing Windows applications, web services, and games using the Unity game engine. This tutorial will cover the fundamental concepts and features of C#.

## Latest Features of C# 🚀

C# continues to evolve with each new version, adding powerful features to make development easier and more efficient. Some of the latest features include:

- **Records**: Immutable data types for easier value comparisons and pattern matching.
- **Pattern Matching Enhancements**: Improved syntax and capabilities for more expressive code.
- **Top-level Statements**: Simplified syntax for small programs and scripts.
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Enhanced type safety to prevent null reference exceptions.
- **Async Streams**: Asynchronous iteration over streams of data.

## Exception Handling ⚠️

Exception handling in C# allows you to manage runtime errors gracefully. The key components are `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`, which help you enclose code that may throw exceptions, handle those exceptions, execute code regardless of exceptions, and manually throw exceptions, respectively.

## Collections 📚

C# provides a rich set of collection classes in the System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic namespaces. Common collections include `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `HashSet<T>`, `Queue<T>`, and `Stack<T>`. These collections help in managing groups of related objects.

## Reference Parameters 🔄

Reference parameters allow you to pass arguments by reference, enabling the method to modify the value of the arguments. This is done using the `ref` keyword, which allows the called method to change the value of the parameter and have that change reflected in the calling method.

## Out Parameters 📨

Out parameters are used to return multiple values from a method. They are declared with the `out` keyword and must be assigned a value before the method returns. This allows methods to output data back to the caller.

## Other Unique Components 🌟

C# includes several components and features that set it apart from other languages:

- **Properties**: Encapsulate fields with getter and setter methods, providing a way to read, write, or compute the value of a private field.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Provides powerful querying capabilities for collections and databases, allowing you to write queries directly in C#.
- **Delegates and Events**: Implement callback methods and event-driven programming, enabling you to pass methods as arguments and handle events in a structured way.
- **Attributes**: Add metadata to your code, providing additional information about program elements, which can be used by the runtime or tools.
